ISE434 HW3

Using a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, a PIR (Motion sensor), a LED and a buzzer  prepare a circuit and write its program to do following actions:

Normally, PIR should be active and HC-SR04 be inactive. 
When PIR senses a person/object in the range, it should activate HC-SR04 and HC-SR04 should measure the distance of the person/object. 
If the distance is less then 200 cm, then your circuit should activate an alarm using LED. If the distance is less than 100 cm, then the alarm should include LED and buzzer. 
Use serial monitor to show distance and other values that you use in your program.
